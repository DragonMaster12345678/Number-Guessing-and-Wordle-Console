# Number-Guessing-and-Wordle-Console
This repository contains code that when executed, will prompt the user to choose between a Number Guessing Game and Wordle, and allows them to play. Everything is in Java.
Please note that this version of Wordle contains a slightly different set of words, and is playable for an infinite number of times, unlike the real Wordle which is limited to one 
play per day. The number guessing game involves guessing a number from one to one thousand. Please let me know if you would like more customization for the number range, or if errors are found.
